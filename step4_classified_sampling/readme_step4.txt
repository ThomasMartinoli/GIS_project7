The sampling is so stuctured:
each memeber of group selects 200 random points (600 points in total)
-33% of points where GHS is not populeted, but WorldPop is populeted
-34% of points where GHS and WorldPop are either both populeted or unpopoleted
-33% of points where GHS is populeted, but WorldPop is not populeted

Then the classified points are merged, and with the usege of the python scrip the two error matrix are extracted.
