This project of comparing and validating two world population maps. <br>
World population maps provide global information, evidence-based analytics, and knowledge on human presence on the planet. The ultimate goal of these
maps is to ensure that every person is mapped and counted within critical operations such as policy making and disasters response. Due to the importance associated with
world population maps, the assessment of accuracy and reliability of these datasets is key to inform any users on benefit and limitations deriving from their usage.
<br>The main project included the whole world, that  was splitted in different areas and distributed on other teams working for the same purpose.<br>
The region of our work was defined by Sub-Area 7, that correspond to the Siberia. <br>
The result that were obtained from the first part of the work as statistical values, maps are collected in this repository, but, most of them are exposed in a interactive web page.
