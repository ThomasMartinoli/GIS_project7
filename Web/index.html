												<h3>Introduction</h3>
												<p>The world population maps are important information that should be acquired for many uses at the
													same time these maps should be accurate and precise due to their uses in multiple sectors. They should
													provide data about the human presence on each part of the Earth as this could be used for the studies
													made on the operating policies and also for determining the critical level of the effect of disasters on
													specific areas of the world.
													<br>
													Therefore, the reliability and accuracy of world population maps is essential. In order to know this
													information an accuracy assessment has to be made to define the limitations of the datasets.
													<br>
													The main purpose of this website is to show the results of a study made on two separate datasets of the
													world’s population. The first provided by the Global Human Settlement and the second by the WorldPop
													Organization. The aim of the study is to compare the correlation between the two maps, then a
													validation process was done to test the accuracy of these results with the reality by manually classifying
													some samples taken on the same area.
													<br>
													Due to the large data and area of the world the study was concentrated on the region of Siberia
													identified by area 7.

												<h3>Data Acquisition</h3>
												<p>
													The studied datasets were provided by the Global Human Settlement Layer from the European
													Commission <a href="https://ghsl.jrc.ec.europa.eu/" target="_blank">(Global Human Settlement - GHSL Homepage - European Commission (europa.eu))</a>, and
													from the WorldPop Organization <a href="https://www.worldpop.org/" target="_blank">(WorldPop)</a>. Both datasets were provided as spatial raster maps that
													portrays the distribution and density of the population on Earth, so the data are provided as the number
													of people living in each cell of the raster map.
													<br>
													The two sources provide the maps for different years, however the study was made on maps for the
													year of 2015. The GHSL supplies the maps in multiple resolutions and coordinate reference systems, the
													properties are the same as the ones provided by the WorldPop, WGS84 as the coordinate reference
													system and 30 arcsec as the resolution of the maps.

										<h2>Assessment Methods</h2>

											<span class="icon fa-gem"></span>
												<h3>Intercomparison</h3>
												<p>
													The first assessment method is to compare the two maps with each other, theoretically they should
													both have the same data such as population density and distribution since they have the same
													properties such as the year of the data and resolution. The intercomparison step is done to compare
													these maps and as they are more similar and their cell values are equal the more, they represent the
													reality and therefore reliable and accurate. Hence the best method to compare them is to calculate the
													difference between them, in addition to determining the correlation between their cell values.

												<h3>Validation</h3>
												<p>
													The validation step is another methodology for the assessment of the maps’ accuracy that rely on the
													comparison of the maps with a reference data collected by a field survey or high-resolution satellite
													imagery photo interpretations. However, this study was limited to 600 sampling points randomly
													distributed in the studied area that are classified manually and used as a reference for the assessment ofthe correctness of the datasets. Moreover, using the reference points, the error matrix of the maps was calculated in addition to accuracy indexes such as the overall accuracy, user’s accuracy, and the
													producer’s accuracy.
