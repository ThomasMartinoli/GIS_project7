												<li>Raster Data Preprocessing</li>
												<p>
													Before the comparison of the maps, they should go under some processing to be prepared for the
													comparison. The first step was to clips the maps to the studied area using the command clip by mask
													where the mask used for the clip was the vector layer of the tiles representing the studied area. After
													applying this command to both the World Pop and GHS Pop maps then the two raster maps the align
													raster command was used to resample the World Pop map on the same grid of the GHS Pop, the two
													maps should have the same resolution and coordinate reference system, however the resampling step
													was made to ensure avoiding small differences as the comparison will be carried out in a pixel-by-pixel
													basis.
													<br>
													In order to avoid map computations errors due to float values so the maps were converted to integer
													raster maps using the tool of raster conversion in the GDAL.
													<br>
													The null value (-32768) spots on the World Pop map is set for areas that are not populated such as
													oceans or inland water bodies, while the same geographical areas excluding the inland water bodies for
													the GHS Pop are defined by another null value (-200) and for the inland water bodies the value of zero. In
													order to have equivalent representation of the data from both maps so some processing was carried out
													on the World Pop raster map. first, using the raster calculator, all null values were set to zero. Later to
													have equivalency with the GHS Pop map so the null values of World Pop were modified to become -200,
													same as the GHS Pop, also using the raster calculator. With the aim of ensuring that the raster metadata
													are correctly updated so the process was repeated using the tool r.null from GRASS by setting the null
													values for both maps as -200.
													<br>
													By this step so the result is two world population raster maps with the same resolution and coordinate
													reference system, having integer values, and same value of -200 representing no data pixels.

												<li>Raster Data Processing (Intercomparison)</li>
												<p>
													the achievement of the purpose of this study is done by comparing the two maps, so after the
													preprocessing and preparation of the maps, then the next step is to compare them. The comparison was
													done by calculating the map of differences between both maps also using the raster calculator. Using
													the map of differences then the basic statistics could be calculated such as min, max, range, mean and
													standard deviation. These statistics were calculated using the tool r.univar.
													<br>
													The correlation between the two maps is an important parameter to be for comparison, in order to
													calculate this parameter the tool r.covar was used. However the correlation between the tiles was
													calculated by clipping each tile individually.
													<br>
													During this process, a problem was faced when calculating the correlation values of each tile, where
													each team member had different values of correlation. The problem was solved when it was found that
													applying the align raster in an opposite way such that World Pop is the reference map and GHS Pop is
													the map to be resampled, so different results were obtained than the order applied in this study. This
													problem is not reasonable to occur since both maps should be having the same resolution, however this
													analysis supports the fact that there exists small differences.
													<br>
													Due to some tiles with values null as the region of Siberia is mainly not inhabited, so many in many tiles
													the correlation value was given as NaN, as a result we had to insert the value of 1 for the correlation in
													these areas as they both have the same value, not populated.

												<li>Preprocessing Data for validation</li>
												<p>
													The validation step required using thematic maps, so the two raster maps of World Pop and GHS Pop
													were reclassified to have only two values either representing an urban pixel, or not urban. The
													reclassification was done using the raster calculator. The result of raster calculator is always a float so
													the maps had to be converted to integers. Due to a bug in the plugin that is used for the classification,
													the difference map had to be calculated, also using the raster calculator, so later also converted to
													integer. After calculating the difference map the value 1 was added just not to have negative values, the
													result is a map that has only 3 values, if the previous reclassification was done correctly each
													corresponding to a specific case of outputs comparison between the two main maps.

												<li>Validation</li>
												<p>
													The validation was done using the plugin AcATaMa in QGIS, as mentioned before the difference map
													was used, only due to a bug in this plugin, for stratifying random sampling points on the studied area. A
													problem that was faced during this step is that the points were obtained sometimes outside the studied
													area, because at first the clip by mask operation was not performed but just clipped the raster maps
													using the feature included in the align raster command, however by using the one in the align raster it
													clips the bounding box, not the exact dimensions of the layer. To overcome this problem the raster
													maps were clipped by mask according to the studied area from the first step before the aligning step.
													<br>
													The random sampling points were chosen to be 600 points, around 200 points for each case scenario
													(GHS Pop is urban but World Pop is not urban, ... etc.).
													<br>
													Another problem faced during the sampling was with the minimum distance between sampling points,
													which was recommended to be 0.08 degrees representing 10 pixels minimum distance between
													sampling points, however the plugin didn’t work with this requirement so we had to set 0 as the
													minimum distance.
													<br>
													The validation was done based on the GHS Pop map as the thematic map. For the manual classification
													the Google, Bing and ESRI satellite imagery maps were used. During classification, the window size was
													adjusted to 0.004 degrees which is the same as the pixel size of the raster maps being validated, since
													the classification in the raster maps is on a pixel level. If only one building exits in the sampling point so
													it was classified as urban, for the reason that in the raster maps we set any value of population different
													from zero so its urban.
													<br>
													As a result, the plugin is able to provide the error matrix for the thematic map selected, GHS Pop in our
													case. This is also a limitation as we want to evaluate the error matrix for both maps, so a python script
													was used to evaluate the error matrix in addition to the accuracy indexes for the other map using the
													same classified sampling points.

												<li>WebGIS</li>
												<p>
													After Intercomparison and Validation phase we use GeoServer to collect the maps obtained.
													Firstly, in GeoServer each of us create a specific WorkSpace: GIS_project7, on which maps are stored.
													Each time that a file is stored is necessary to distinguish beetwen the different format 
													(in our case we have the following format .shp, .gpkg, and .GeoTIFF) and put the correct boundary.
													Furthermore different styles are imported from Qgis (format file .sld) in this way is possible to customize the maps, and
													put in evidence their features thanks to colors and shades, so to obtain a better visualization and rappresentation.
													<br>
													GeoServer has a relavant part during the realization of the webpage, because OpenLayers is used to generate interactive maps,
													and to add WMS layers and/or WFS layers we exploit GeoServer calling the appropriate URL to invoque the right layer, for example: 
													<br>
													http://localhost:8082/geoserver/wms
													<br>
													http://localhost:8082/geoserver/WORKSPACE_NAME/ows?service=WFS
													<br>
													WMS allows to visualize the raster and vector as image, instead WFS gives also the possibility to obtain
													information, so it is used to adding a popup in same case.

												<li>Website</li>
												<p>
													The creation of the webpage is the final phase, on which we put toghert out work.
													We start from a predifinate template: Editorial (https://html5up.net/)
													<br>
													The idea is not to create a website that could cointain only our work, but also the work of the other groups, 
													in this way it is possible to have a site that cover the entire Globe, and this is why in the princiapl menu is possiple
													to select the desired area. Obviosly we developed only our.
													<br>
													Unfortunately we have some problems with the template: the code for the WFS layers works correctly, but if we try to insert 
													it in the pages we obtain a error (.popover is not a function), so to solve the problem we decide to creare appropriate pages
													on which visualaze maps and layers, but also introducing the obtained result, as the covariance, and the Error matrix for the 
													validation phase.
